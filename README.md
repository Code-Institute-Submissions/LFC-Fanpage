## What does it do and what need does it fulfil?

This website project was undertaken to improve and showcase my current front-end development skill set. It fulfils almost all of the needs for LFC fans who are looking to learn more about the club or the staff/team members. The page offers videos, images, player profiles, interviews and a page describing Liverpool's rich history playing in the UEFA Champions League along with a sign-up form allowing users to get regular updates.

## Functionality of project:

This website is fully responsive - the designs were purposely simplified to ensure that all the content for the mobile first design would fit onto the desktop view. for the navigation bar, I need to reference a Udemy Course as I used their Javascript code to ensure that the page scrolled to a specific page when clicked rather then an instant movement, and to ensure that the navbar became transparent once the user scrolled past a certain point. I also used Udemy to aid with the animations that I coded used on the player profiles page, the carousel for the history page and for the form at the sign- up page. I had to use Udemy for help as I have not yet learned how to code with JavaScript but I really wanted to implement the animations.

## Features 

#### Features Used

##### Feature 1: Navbar
This features was used to ensure that the user can navigate throughout the website with ease and speed. The mobile first design means that the burger icon will change to a fixed navbar at the top of the screen with all of the anchor tags visible.

##### Feature 2: Home Page
This feature was designed to be as simple as possible, allowing the user to use the Navbar to reach the parts of the website with the content. There is a fixed background to make it look more professional.

##### Feature 3: Player Profiles
This section had an image of each of the players, their names, position, nationality and their Premier League Records. the cards have been positioned into the actual fomration positions that they would play. I added animations for the cards once they have been selected to make it as clear and visually pleasing as possible.

##### Feature 4: European History
For this page I used a carousel as there were five different historical events that I wanted to display. The carousel allowed me to fit all this on one page for both the mobile size and desktop, whilst having fixed background of Anfield.

##### Feature 5: Media
This section features three videos of Jurgen Klopp during interviews and three videos showing the users all of the Premier League goals from the last three seasons.

##### Feature 6: News and Transfers
This section offers brief quotes from Jurgen Klopp, Gary Lineker and Roberto Firminho. This section has both images and paragraphs on a carousel to ensure thay all the information will work with a mobile-first design method.

##### Feature 7: Sign Up Page
This page is split vertically for desktop view to ensure all the information is very visible and easy to access. the left hand side contains all the conntact details and social media links while the left hand side, which drops to the bottom for mobile devices has a form, so that users can sign up for weekly updates.

## Technologies Used 
* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* Bootstrap 
* Bash Ubuntu 
* GIT 
* GITHUB 
* Google Chrome developer tools 
* Cloud 9 IDE 
* Javascript was imported for the animations, navbar and carousel.

## Deployment
Website was coded in the Cloud 9 IDE, a local GIT directory was used for version control and then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: https://jjwain.github.io/LFC-Fanpage/

## Testing 
Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality as well as look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. All links were tested along with music tracks audio controls and video player. The modal join fan club form and the hire us form was tested locally and remotely.

##Work based on other code 
As described earlier, the navbar, page animations, the carousel and the form used Javascript which was based off the Udemy Bootstrap NUNO course. Outside of JavaScript I used the Bootstrap website to help me structure certain pages of the website as I have very limited experience as of yet. The structure of the landing page for example is fairly similar to the NUNO landing page, however all of the color schemes and custom designed were completely tailored for my website.

## What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase
I had planned of having a page specific to Liverpools up and coming fixtures. After completing UDX I discovered that Liverpool has only one game of the season left and a long summer break, so I decided that I wanted to create a page with news and transfers and to create a form allowing users to fill their contact information - which would put them on a mail list for weekly updates - once I complete the JavaScript.

## Media 
The fixed background images that I used for the landing page and the history page were both from Pexels.com. The images that were used on the player profiles were from the official LFC website, and the images that were used for the News & Transfers page came from Google images.
